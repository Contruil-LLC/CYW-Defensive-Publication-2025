## Disclosed Inventions Summary

This defensive publication establishes prior art for three core inventions:

### 1. Triangle Test Protocol
Multi-model AI routing system using VLAN-style role assignments where heterogeneous AI models occupy specialized functional layers for collaborative task completion.

**Key Innovation:** Dynamic routing of user requests across multiple AI models (Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, ChatGPT) based on specialized roles (Research, Synthesis, Audit, Critique, Integration).

### 2. Four-Gate Authorization Framework
Human governance system enforcing mandatory approval checkpoints throughout the AI orchestration workflow.

**Key Innovation:** Four distinct authorization gates ensuring human oversight at critical decision points: Intent Validation, Routing Approval, Output Review, and Final Authorization.

### 3. Evidence Ledger Architecture
Cryptographically-linked audit trail system for AI model interactions with tamper-evident provenance tracking.

**Key Innovation:** SHA-256 hash chains linking sequential evidence records with multi-backend storage capabilities (SQLite, PostgreSQL, S3, blockchain) for immutable interaction history.
