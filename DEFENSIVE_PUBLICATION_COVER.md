## Technical Scope

### Virgil OS — Multi-Model Orchestration

The Virgil OS system implements a novel approach to multi-model AI orchestration, featuring:

- **Layered routing architecture** with explicit logical and physical topology documentation
- **Patent-aligned claim mapping** ensuring implementation coverage of all claimed elements
- **Failure-focused test scenarios** validating resilience under network, dependency, state, and configuration failures
- **Evidence integration** linking test results to patent claims and audit trails

### CYW Methodology

The Control Your World (CYW) methodology provides:

- **VLAN-based cognitive segmentation** routing tasks to appropriate processing layers
- **Guardian verification protocol** ensuring quality gates at each deployment stage
- **Terminology migration framework** for transitioning legacy systems to infrastructure-first language
- **Metrics and measurement framework** for data-driven optimization

### Master Index Governance

The Master Index system establishes:

- **Standardized search string conventions** for rapid artifact discovery
- **Artifact lifecycle management** with version control and state transitions
- **Cross-reference dependency mapping** linking artifacts to patent claims and evidence bundles
- **Access control protocols** with flatten export commands for attorney packets

## Verification

This publication package includes cryptographic hashes for verification:

- **SHA-256** (primary verification)
- **SHA-512** (redundancy)
- **SHA-1** (reference)
- **MD5** (legacy compatibility)

See the accompanying `verification_record_*.txt` file for complete hash values and verification commands.
