## Sovereign Certificate

This repository includes a cryptographic deployment verification system that ensures the local provenance chain matches the live deployment.

**Core guarantees:**
- Hash chain rebuild and validation run before every deployment.
- Git commits provide timestamped, tamper-evident records.
- Remote audit compares local hashes to live site content.

**Primary commands:**
- `make deploy` — rebuild → validate → commit → push → remote audit
- `make audit` — verify remote integrity without redeploying

**Implementation:** See `Makefile` and `scripts/validation/remote_audit.sh`.
