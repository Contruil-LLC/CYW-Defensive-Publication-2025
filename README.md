## 📋 Disclosed Inventions

### 1. Triangle Test Protocol
Multi-model AI routing system using VLAN-style role assignments where heterogeneous AI models (Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, ChatGPT) occupy specialized functional layers:
- **Research VLAN:** Information gathering and retrieval
- **Synthesis VLAN:** Narrative expansion and content generation
- **Audit VLAN:** Clarity verification and quality assessment
- **Critique VLAN:** Structural analysis and improvement identification
- **Integration VLAN:** Final compilation and coherence optimization

### 2. Four-Gate Authorization Framework
Human governance system enforcing mandatory approval checkpoints:
- **Gate 1:** Intent Validation - User confirms system understood request correctly
- **Gate 2:** Routing Approval - User approves or modifies proposed model sequence
- **Gate 3:** Output Review - User evaluates intermediate outputs before proceeding
- **Gate 4:** Final Authorization - User explicitly authorizes result commitment

### 3. Evidence Ledger Architecture
Cryptographically-linked audit trail system for AI model interactions:
- SHA-256 hash chains linking sequential evidence records
- Tamper-evident provenance tracking
- Immutable interaction history
- Multi-backend storage (SQLite, PostgreSQL, S3, blockchain)
