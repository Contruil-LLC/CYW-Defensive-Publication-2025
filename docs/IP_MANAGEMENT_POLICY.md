## Organization: Contruil-LLC

**Effective Date:** December 25, 2025  
**Last Updated:** December 30, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

## Purpose

This policy establishes Contruil-LLC's systematic approach to intellectual property (IP) management, defensive publications, and open-source contributions. Our goal is to protect innovations through strategic prior art establishment while maintaining transparency and public benefit.

## Policy Statement

Contruil-LLC believes in:
1. **Open Innovation:** Sharing technical innovations with the public domain
2. **Strategic IP Protection:** Using defensive publications to establish prior art
3. **Transparency:** Clear documentation of inventions and their disclosure dates
4. **Public Benefit:** Making innovations freely available to advance technology

## IP Management Framework

### Defensive Publication Strategy

Contruil-LLC uses defensive publications as our primary IP protection mechanism:

- **Purpose:** Establish prior art to prevent future patent claims
- **Method:** Public disclosure through timestamped GitHub repositories
- **Benefit:** Ensures innovations remain in the public domain
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive technical disclosure with clear priority dates

### Publication Requirements

All defensive publications must include:
1. Detailed technical disclosure of the invention
2. Clear priority date and inventor attribution
3. Publication timestamp through version control
4. Evidence chain linking to organizational history
5. Public accessibility through open repositories

### Repository Structure

Each defensive publication repository follows this structure:

```
/docs/
  PATENT_DISCLOSURE.md     - Formal invention disclosure
  PRIOR_ART.md            - Timeline and evidence chain
