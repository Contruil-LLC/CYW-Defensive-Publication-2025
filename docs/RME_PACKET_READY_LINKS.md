# RME Packet – Ready Links

**Purpose:** Consolidated reference for RME Process Assistant / RME Tech mobility applications. Four documents that prove systems thinking, troubleshooting rigor, and safety-first ownership.

---

## 1. Portfolio Root
**Link:** [timothywheels.com](https://timothywheels.com)

**What it proves:**
- You architect systems end-to-end—documentation isn't an afterthought, it's infrastructure
- Cryptographic verification, deployment automation, and defensive publication demonstrate engineering rigor at enterprise scale

**Why it matters:**  
Shows you think like an engineer who owns outcomes, not just tasks. RME roles require this same systems-first mindset.

---

## 2. Failure Mode Runbook
**Link:** [timothywheels.com/docs/FAILURE_MODE_RUNBOOK.md](https://timothywheels.com/docs/FAILURE_MODE_RUNBOOK.md)

**What it proves:**
- You troubleshoot backward from impact—mapping symptoms to root cause like triaging network outages
- Decision trees, emergency recovery protocols, and 5-Why frameworks mirror RME diagnostic procedures

**Why it matters:**  
RME lives in failure scenarios. This shows you've already indexed the terrain and can triage under pressure.

## 3. RME Translation Guide
**Link:** [timothywheels.com/docs/RME_TRANSLATION.md](https://timothywheels.com/docs/RME_TRANSLATION.md)

**What it proves:**
- You bridge domains—translating CYW orchestration logic into conveyor reliability without losing precision
- Leadership talking points demonstrate ability to communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders

**Why it matters:**  
Demonstrates you learn fast and contextualize prior expertise instead of starting from zero. Process Assistants translate between operations and maintenance daily.

---

## 4. Threat Model Analysis
**Link:** [timothywheels.com/docs/THREAT_MODEL.md](https://timothywheels.com/docs/THREAT_MODEL.md)

**What it proves:**
- You assess risk systematically—LOTO, lockout procedures, and hazard mitigation aren't compliance theater, they're designed-in
- Red team testing and incident response frameworks show proactive ownership of safety protocols

**Why it matters:**  
Shows ownership of the safety layer, not just the technical layer. RME roles require defensive thinking about equipment failure modes and personnel safety.

## 3-Minute Demo Script

### [0:00–0:30] The Hook
"I'm Fly. Waterspider. CIS student. Veteran. I built an AI orchestration framework that treats creative workflows like network infrastructure—and now I'm translating that same systems thinking into RME."

### [0:30–1:30] The Proof
"Here's what that looks like in practice:
- **Failure Mode Runbook** – I mapped common conveyor/sorter failures to diagnostic trees, the same way I'd troubleshoot VLAN misconfigurations
- **RME Translation** – I took my CYW framework and rebuilt it as reliability protocols: routing, redundancy, fault isolation
- **Threat Model** – I designed a safety-first risk matrix because ownership means engineering out hazards, not reacting to incidents"

### [1:30–2:30] The Bridge
"Why does a Waterspider with an AI framework care about RME?  

Because I see the same patterns:
- Conveyors are data pipes. Jams are packet loss.
- Preventive maintenance is health checks.
- Downtime costs are measured in throughput, same as latency in distributed systems.

I don't just want to *fix* equipment. I want to *own* uptime the way I own my workflows—designed, documented, defensible."

### [2:30–3:00] The Close
"This packet is my technical interview. Four links. Four proof points.  

I'm not asking you to bet on potential—I'm showing you the infrastructure is already built.

Let's talk about what reliability engineering looks like when it's treated as a product, not a reaction."

**That's when it clicked:**  
RME isn't about motors and sensors—it's about designing systems that *stay online*.

**This is how you Control Your World.**
