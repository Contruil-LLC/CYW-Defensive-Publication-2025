## STAR Interview Response: Amazon RME

- **Situation:** During my IT transition, I saw academic and professional documentation lacked a truth layer, leading to confusion and data drift.
- **Task:** I needed to create a system that guaranteed the integrity of project provenance.
- **Action:** I designed and deployed a cryptographic hash chain using Bash and YAML, automating parent-child handshakes so any change triggers a mismatch flag.
- **Result:** I reduced manual verification time to zero and created a self-healing documentation pipeline that is fully auditable.
